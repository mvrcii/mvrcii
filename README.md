### Hi, I'm Marcel 👋

I am a Machine Learning & Computer Vision researcher focused on solving difficult, unstructured data problems. I specialize in **2D/3D segmentation**, **Document AI**, and **LLM/VLM fine-tuning**.

I don't just train models; I build data engines and custom architectures to extract signal from extreme noise.

#### 🏆 Featured Work: Vesuvius Challenge First Title Winner
**I won the First Title Prize by decoding the unreadable.**
My team developed a custom 3D Computer Vision pipeline to detect ink in carbonized Herculaneum scrolls.
* **The Problem:** Segmenting characters in 3D volumetric X-ray scans where the human eye sees nothing.
* **The Solution:** Designed **MiniUNETR** (a lightweight 3D Transformer/CNN hybrid) and built an iterative "ignore-mask" data engine to handle uncertainty.
* **The Result:** Successfully extracted the first readable title from Scroll 5.
